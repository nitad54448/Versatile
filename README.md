# Versatile 2

VERSATILE 2 is a computer program designed for the evaluation of nonisothermal kinetic parameters by processing thermogravimetric data. It is described in an old paper: N. Dragoe and E. Segal, Thermochimica Acta, 1991, 129-134.
The core of its methodology is the optimization of kinetic parameter values through the least squares method. The optimal values are identified as those corresponding to the maximum absolute value of the correlation coefficient from a linear regression. The version described here was written in Visual Basic 6 on a Windows 95 computer. You'll need some work to make it work on modern computers. 

## Key Features

**Calculation Methods**: The program can evaluate nonisothermal kinetic parameters using nine different methods:

* Kissinger.
* Freeman-Carroll
* Coats-Redfern
* Flynn-Wall for $\alpha=$ const.
* Flynn-Wall for $\beta=$ const.
* Flynn-Wall for $T=$ const. 
* Reich method.
* Doyle method.
* A modified Coats-Redfern method.
